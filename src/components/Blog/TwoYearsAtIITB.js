                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  A little girl came to Bombay with her dreams packed in a
                  suitcase (okay, suitcases, I mean I love clothes too much, I
                  can't help) with the plan to make her own mark with whatever
                  comes her way! <br /> <br />
                  This fearless bold girl however wasn't really confident this
                  time. She did receive her fair share of applauses for clearing
                  "the JEE" but parallelly she was cautioned about the brightest
                  kids of the country, she'll be meeting at IIT Bombay CSE! I
                  was intimidated by the people I'll meet at insti, and felt
                  that I would not fit and always feel out of the place! I
                  thought that I would be friends with none and would die alone!
                  However, as being excited is my ground state, I was super
                  excited to start my new journey! <br /> <br />
                  Remembering my first "rainy" day at insti in middle of all the
                  very "important" orientations, I was trying to have first
                  conversations with people and make new friends! Thanks to my
                  extrovert nature I made a lot of friends in my first semester!
                  That time was just magically, I haven't felt that innocent in
                  while now:)! It actually felt like we were getting rewarded
                  for the preparations for two or more years! <br /> <br />
                  Even though my fear of not making any friends and being a
                  loner died out too quickly, I was still very intimidated by
                  such talented people all around me, some with exceptional
                  literature knowledge, the guitar guys (no stereotyping sorry),
                  some with amazing humor (okay, I didn't meet any such person
                  else we would be dating currently!) or obviously some with
                  extremely great IQ! <br /> <br />
                  One thing that I would say is non-negotiable in first year is
                  to have a good CPI. Aim for a stellar one -- you know as they
                  say even if you fail, you still land on moon! The mistake I
                  think I did in the first semester was of doubting myself too
                  much. I wasn't sure how well I could perform which lead to me
                  setting lower expectations for myself and hence achieving less
                  that what I do now. To top that up, in my first semester, I
                  was in a group of all toppers, everyone being perfect 10
                  holders! I mean I wasn't a poor performer but I wasn't even a
                  perfect 10 scorer. I used to do decently well but when I used
                  to be score less compared to my friends, I used to feel low to
                  everyone else in the insti! My friends were supportive no
                  doubt, but the power of self doubt undoes every other thing. I
                  was too harsh with myself and hence had little confidence that
                  I could do well.
                  <br /> <br />
                  However, this self doubt didn't stop me from trying out
                  different initiatives in insti and PORs. I was the Class
                  Representative of my batch which helped me connect with a lot
                  batchmates and seniors in CS. I also was very interested in
                  entrepreneurship and took part if different competitions by
                  E-Cell, including the E-Buzz competition in which our team
                  secured the first position in among all freshmen. (Well, that
                  was a pretty confidence boast xD) I took part in Manch 3.0
                  which turned out to be an year long affair and I still have
                  some Amazon coupons to spend which I ended up winning for
                  being overall third. I also did try to participate in some
                  dance events, but my super shy ass didn't me through the end.
                  <br /> <br />
                  All things combined, I'd say I had an amazing first semester
                  and I guess I was most carefree then (only to bear
                  consequences later xD). I still miss the late night chats
                  sitting in the canteen shed, when it was raining high, and all
                  of me and my friends were sharing their school stories and
                  just letting out all the fear and anxiety we have faced. We
                  went out to a couple of places in Mumbai, including the
                  mandatory Marine Drive after Midsems. I went on my first trek
                  which could have been my last, had I not being helped by 10
                  people including my friends and the trainer. Well, at least
                  I'm not going again till I don't get fit and have the right
                  kind of shoes coz mine just sucked in all the dirt and water!
                  <br /> <br />
                  Although your little Dora's exploration of the city began
                  after we were done with endsems and waiting for the papers to
                  get checked and cribs being handled. None of us 12 in my group
                  of friends went back home and we were there all day and the
                  only task to do was to go to new places, try out new food and
                  enjoy! We went to Imagica! Just to digress a bit, I want to
                  highlight that if you're still a kid like me, don't go on the
                  scary rides, even if your friends tell you that it'll be
                  absolutely okay, else you'll just end up lying fainted in your
                  friends arms. Overall, Imagica was a fun experience for me but
                  I may not go there again unless you're buying my tickets. We
                  also went to Barbeque Nation, where I'm again not going unless
                  I turn non-vegetarian. We watched two movies as well, one was
                  Chichore in which I didn't feel very goose-bumpy then but now
                  at my home, I'll use up all the tissue papers crying out!  The
                  other was Ford vs Ferrari, during which I slept in the middle,
                  so don't ask me the story line. However, the thing that is
                  close to my heart were the nightouts that we did on the roof
                  tops of VMCC and other buildings in the insti.
                  <br /> <br />
                  When I finally came back home after those 4+ super fast paced
                  months at insti, I got the time to think and figure out what
                  went wrong in the first semester and what I should improve
                  from next semester! It was super easy for me to figure out
                  that I could do much better academically only if I wasn't
                  scared and didn't compare myself with my friends so I decided
                  to be a little more serious from next semester and spend less
                  time with my friends and focus more on me and my academics.
                  <br /> <br />
                  My first winter break wasn't well planned and I just wasted
                  the initial time chatting with my insti friends. However I had
                  to participate in the Inter IIT Tech 8.0 which had to happen
                  at IIT Roorkee. So I flew back to Bombay from where I had to
                  go to Roorkee again. Yes, quite surprising for me too to make
                  it to the team in first year but a hell of a experience it
                  was!
                  <br /> <br />
                  I initially thought of not including this topic in this blog
                  but then it has been important to me, so I guess it would be
                  an injustice if I skip it. But as a responsible writer, let me
                  warn you of the cringe that I'll be throwing at you for the
                  couple next paragraphs.
                  <br /> <br />
                  So! I met a guy in the beautiful chilly winters of Roorkee,
                  (well I met him in insti only, but it sounds more romantic
                  that way). Never in my 20 years of life have I met such an
                  attractive person. I was so deeply in awe of his personality
                  and attractiveness that I barely could land my eyes on anyone
                  else.  The days at Roorkee flew by so quickly and I ended up
                  winning Bronze in my competition. However, for a long time I
                  made the joke, that for real I won a diamond:)  <br /> <br />
                  I was so shit scared that we wouldn't be in contact when we
                  reach insti (yk, things that happen in Roorkee, stay in
                  Roorkee!) that I didn't leave him till we were at the terminal
                  gate of my flight and there was no way he was catching the
                  same flight and I had to say goodbye to that sweetheart!
                  <br /> <br />
                  Back in Mumbai, I attended the Mood Indigo, you know the
                  Asia's largest college culture festival. It was a nice
                  experience, however you could get by the fact that I slept in
                  Deepika's show -- I didn't care coz my heart had already got
                  someone else's attraction who didn't happen to be in Mumbai,
                  so I was updating him with what he was missing by not
                  attending MI including Zakir, Deepika and ofcourse me! <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  Back when the second semester started, I was clear to set my
                  priorities right, having academics on top. I decreased the
                  amount of time I spent with my friends in first semester and
                  naturally made some new friends. I started planning my weeks
                  ahead which had helped me keep track of my academic work and
                  other small commitments that I had taken up like in the first
                  semester. I was "trying" to eat healthy by buying fruits in
                  different weeks which I really liked! And I decreased
                  comparing and criticizing myself now and then drastically.  I
                  was able to take up extracurricular responsibilities that I
                  was interested in and spent some decent time with my first. My
                  scale was balanced out! From quite long, I had an eye for one
                  thing, no not the guy! but Mars Rover Technical Team (MRT), I
                  really wanted to be in MRT since the orientation day when I
                  first got to know about it! There were some convenor
                  applications that started soon enough and took a bit of time
                  to fill the forms and write SOPs.
                  <br /> <br />
                  As my irrational fear of not making a single friend broke out
                  pretty quick, the fear that "we" won't be in contact when we
                  reach insti broke out as well. We did meet in insti, quite a
                  times, it was a ritual I guess, meeting every Thursdays. His
                  presence "somehow" made all my problems easier. As cheesy as
                  it may sound, he was like my comfy home in insti. No doubt my
                  family liked him! I went on the best Valentine's Date I could
                  think of. We went out couple more times and also some cute
                  nightouts, and then this corona happened and we had to be back
                  home! And I was left to contemplate why didn't I kiss that
                  idiot when I had the chance to!
                  <br /> <br />
                  Well that was 0.75 real part of my story at IIT Bombay and
                  rest is the 1.25 imaginary part of the story at the "online
                  setup" in these "unprecedent times". <br /> <br />
                  Continuing, he proposed me almost just after we came home (and
                  obviously I said yes) thinking it would be just 15 days break
                  and then we would be back together in campus. Little did we
                  (or anyone) knew it would extend to fucking 1.25 years and
                  still counting! <br /> <br />
                  My first year summers were quite an amazing experience.
                  Started off little slow with me figuring out what things to
                  do. As a regular freshie, I took up SOS, SOC and ITSP (dropped
                  later on) and started working with it. I was afraid with
                  coding in my first year (Yes, my major is Computer Science!)
                  but then I spend a huge amount of summer coding. I did a lot
                  of online courses and did a lot of mini-projects that helped
                  me improve my coding skills. I was also the part of Tapestry
                  Web Development team and worked on the frontend. Trust me, I
                  had no idea about React and Redux but in the small amount of
                  time that we had, I learnt it all and completed the project. I
                  also did the Krittika Summer Project by the astronomy club of
                  our institute, Krittika, which was an awesome project and also
                  gave me a sense of being connected with my astronomy love. I
                  also was selected for a UX-UI Research based project under Ms.
                  Melaine Lent who is a Product Consultant at Accenture to work
                  on the Roommate Matching Application project (we are still
                  working on that). I was so afraid of CP but in this summers I
                  also started CP over Codechef mainly (okay, that was purely to
                  impress my boyfriend, but I still did xD). I also started
                  volunteering for Women Who Code, Mumbai.
                  <br /> <br />
                  These summers were best for me as I discovered that I could do
                  much more than the boundaries I've been setting across for
                  myself. I figured out my secret was to hustle, take up new
                  projects, online courses and managing/ leadership activities
                  which interests me, as they came along. I spent a lot of my
                  time in front of the laptop working on projects and stuff and
                  the remaining rest of my free time chatting you know with
                  whom. I didn't go out anywhere entire summers obviously
                  because of the lockdown. <br /> <br />
                  Semester 3, as they say is the most difficult of all for CS
                  students and it's kind of a big "giant leap" that we as CS
                  sophomores take when we step into the second year. So, I was
                  all prepped up for this ruthless semester with all my planners
                  done, my notebooks ready to be filled up with all the lecture
                  notes (oh yes, I still do that!) and importantly my mind set
                  for the hardships to come along also given the online setting!{" "}
                  <br /> <br />
                  One week into the semester and he broke up. Oh yes, it was
                  that sudden. Initially my mind didn't just accept that
                  something happened but then the hurt from the other side
                  increased to a point where I couldn't bear anymore and I
                  decided to cut off. It shattered me completely and I could
                  feel the pain. During almost the entire semester 3, I was
                  going through a very emotionally unstable time. I also cut off
                  with almost all my friends except my best friend and didn't
                  interact with others much, which was pretty harsh for myself
                  given my extrovert and chirpy nature. <br /> <br />
                  My schedule was more or less, attending lectures, completing
                  assignments, crying and going back to sleep. And I was pretty
                  critic of myself, as in a normal setup I usually would so much
                  more than just academics but this sem, I wasn't able to
                  anything other than academics (and cry xD). Weeks by weeks, I
                  was trying to put up different projects or responsibilities on
                  my schedule which weren't just getting done, which gave me
                  chance to look down upon myself again. I was seeing FB posts
                  of some machaxx people in insti which made me criticize myself
                  again and not save the world dying of corona! My journal from
                  then would read something like, "why am I thinking about this
                  stupid problem, why don't I feel like saving the world, why
                  can't I be like Obama, why is this thing bothering me". <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  Oh boy, I was a hard mother for myself! I was trying to push
                  myself too much to get out of the cycle and be on my old
                  routine of working my ass off! This did result in some good as
                  my pushy nature ensured that I was properly apping to
                  different unvis and profs. I also contacted some seniors for
                  some apping advices, one of which is my closest friend
                  presently! Apping somewhat helped me get my current internship
                  at Indiana University as well. I was also able to contribute
                  to the Roommate Matching project which I would attribute to my
                  motivating mentor and hardworking co-mentee from Caltech.
                  Lately, I've been thinking that that maybe it is good to push
                  ourselves and raise our limits but only to a point that we
                  don't break ourselves.
                  <br /> <br />
                  I also would mention that I was in contact with a SWC mentor
                  which I don't want to skip as she really helped me let out my
                  thoughts weekly and I guess its good to consider if you're
                  having an emotional period specially with this lockdown,
                  second wave and emerging third wave! <br /> <br />
                  Winter breaks are usually small in insti but this years was
                  smaller coz all of our year's holidays were sucked into corona
                  holiday's earlier only. We had about a month long with us.The
                  best thing that happened this winter was FeMeal, my startup.
                  Originally we started with preparing for the Hult Prize
                  competition which we won and then we started pursing this full
                  time. This truly was when I felt good and confident about
                  myself after 4 months. I did a short 1.5 months long intern at
                  Idfy, Mumbai. This is such a nice company with such great
                  corporative vibes lol! I got payed well so that ticked all the
                  boxes. I wasn't super productive again but as time heals
                  everything, I was better. I wanted to take things slow because
                  the counter productive game that goes in my head became quite
                  clear to me! <br /> <br />
                  I wanted to start reading again which I did -- oh man, when
                  the little sun rises in the cold winters and you can for once
                  laze out outside, feeling like an old women and read your book
                  -- it feels so satisfying:) I read "And then they were none"
                  -- which was a nice 'one-time' read book and the "Startup
                  Sutra" which was again a nice 'one-time' read. I started
                  working diligently towards Women Who Code and took lead for
                  organizing various events. I didn't get on a regular bath
                  schedule again which is fair, given the icy cold winters North
                  have! <br /> <br />
                  For the semester 4, I honestly didn't plan a lot as my
                  planning failed majorly last semester. I however did plan one
                  thing which was taking 54 credits. Well yes, I saw this as the
                  only way to do justice to my CPI drop last semester. For the
                  courses, I didn't even choose the easier ones, coz you know if
                  I have to do it, I'll do it tough. I knew that as my academic
                  load would be high and I'd have to work on my startup, FeMeal
                  along with preparing for Hult Prize Regionals (to be held in
                  February), I would have less time to weep! <br /> <br />
                  January was the most packed month for me, I had my intern from
                  winters going on as well. I had to work for FeMeal and had
                  planned two events for WWC that I was leading, all of this
                  along with my academics to manage, I was super serious about
                  academics this semester as I had to increase my CPI. My elder
                  cousin brother came home in around then and oh god which is
                  when I realized how much I missed human contact! By February,
                  I guess my soul returned to my body and I was back chirpy, on
                  the track with the academics and every other commitment I had
                  to manage. I was sad sometimes but then maybe because I
                  resonated too much with the meme -- "Mera Janam toh Gayal hone
                  ke liye hi hua hai", I was back normal pretty quickly. I
                  reconnected with my old school friends and it was super fun!
                  This was the semester I started working for MRT devotedly as
                  well, did some coding and helped onboard freshies in the team
                  smoothly.
                  <br /> <br />
                  After midsems, I was more focused on academics (I guess that
                  happens with everyone lol!) and I gave less time to some less
                  prioritized commitments. I was "officially" selected for my
                  Indiana intern by that time and even those meetings began to
                  happen. I applied for Department Research Coordinator and got
                  selected for the year 21-22. Inter IIT Tech came again this
                  year in about March and we won Silver (in a high prep
                  challenge) and were second overall! This year the tech meet
                  was much more huge and we had an amazing team, which I
                  absolutely enjoyed working with! Oh and thankfully, I didn't
                  fall in love this year:) <br /> <br />
                  The most amazing and important thing that I did this semester
                  was losing my weight. I didn't had much, but I gained a couple
                  kgs in this lockdown and I had thyroid. After some fruitless
                  efforts of some weeks of leaving sugar, I contacted one of my
                  very close friends (yes, the same apping tips guy) who himself
                  had lost massive weight who guided me on my "weight loss
                  journey" -- it ain't too much but honest work. I like a good
                  pupil followed him and now I feel good about my body:)
                  Finally, the semester ended which I feel like the longest till
                  now xD with overall nice grades and yes my CPI is back to
                  normal again:) Oh I didn't mention I guess, but I did came in
                  touch with all my insti friends again:)
                  <br /> <br />
                  So yes, this was a brief peek in my 2 years journey at IIT
                  Bombay, full of ups and downs. I would say that I hustle too
                  much and hence sometime end up getting in trouble which I'm
                  completely okay with. I like to try different projects and
                  things that interests me to do more. <br /> <br />
                  Finally, as legends do, some advice that I would give my
                  freshie self would be -- don't doubt yourself, you're just as
                  good as others and you're a strong hardworking person who
                  knows how to work for things that actually matter -- so you
                  will sail through, oh and yes, don't fill in the form for
                  Inter IIT Tech, just don't xD!
